          NEW FOR 2022. <span class="text-orange-9">CRASH TEST ACADEMY</span> is available as a part of this fall's conference. This opportunity is limited to <strong>8</strong> attendees as outlined below. The first eight registered will be allowed to attend with a wait-list created if necessary.

        <br>
        <div class="text-black text-body1">
          The MATAI annual conference continues to grow each year. We have advanced our crash test research in recent years to include highly sophisticated crash test instrumentation and robotic steering devices to steer the vehicles into various crash scenarios.  Beginning in 2022, MATAI will offer attendees the option to participate in the “Crash Test Academy” (CTA), which will provide hands-on experience with all aspects of planning, execution and presentation of full scale automobile crash tests.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="text-black text-body1">
          Crash test day is the result of many hours of pre-crash planning by our crash team that includes working with local vendors to obtain vehicles, devising a crash plan based on the vehicles that are available, preparing each vehicle for the instrument package that may include multiple accelerometers, roll rate sensors, seat belt load cells and robotic steering device and executing the plan safely to produce meaningful and useful results.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="text-black text-body1">
          Once the crash test takes place, the fun really begins. Video and photographs files have to be reviewed and video edited, data from the instrumentation has to be processed into meaningful and a cogent data presentation has to be created to present to conference attendees on the final day of the conference each year.
        </div>
        <div class="text-black text-body1">
          The Crash Test Academy will be available to <strong>eight</strong> conference attendees. The goal of CTA is to provide information to the attendees about the instrumentation available and methods for collecting and analyzing data. The attendees will plan and actually conduct one of the tests at the 2022 MATAI Conference. This will include instrumentation of the test vehicles, collection and analysis all data collected and presentation of the data on the last day of the conference.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="text-black text-body1">
          Attendees will work with Video VBoxHD and Garmin data and a variety of data acquisition systems such as Diversified Technical Systems (DTS), Instrumented Sensor Technology (IST), DaDisp data analysis software and data processing using Microsoft Excel.
        </div>
        <br> <!--DAY ONE-->
        <div class="text-bold text-h5 text-black-9">CTA Schedule</div>
        <div class="text-bold text-h6 text-bold text-black-9">Saturday, 9/10/2022, Day 1, 9:00 a.m.</div>
        <div class="text-black text-body1">
          We will convene in the classroom and begin the introduction to data acquisition theory, principles and practices, and we'll look at how to operate specific data collection systems commonly encountered in crash tests. Attendees will get be introduced to the instrumentation, data acquisition hardware and software, camera and video availability and operation. Two vehicles will be assigned to the CTA attendees (one bullet and one target). <br> <br>
          Attendees will be divided into a “bullet” team and “target” team. Team captains will be selected. Development of team names are encouraged. After lunch, the teams will inspect the vehicles, begin documentation and return to the classroom to work out a crash plan. Specific parameters of each test, and goals for the test will be discussed and included in the planning process.
        </div>
        <br><!--DAY TWO-->
        <div class="text-bold text-h6 text-bold text-black-9">Sunday, 9/11/2022, Day 2, 9:00 a.m.</div>
        <div class="text-black text-body1">
          Teams will convene in the classroom, go over the crash plan, make revisions as needed then commence with vehicle preparation and perform all pre-test activity outlined in the crash plan.
        </div>
        <br><!--DAY THREE-->
        <div class="text-bold text-h7 text-blue-9">MATAI Conference Begins</div>
        <div class="text-bold text-h6 text-bold text-black-9">Monday, 9/12/2022, Day 3, 7:00 a.m.</div>
        <div class="text-black text-body1">
          CTA teams will be on the track with the MATAI crash crew and will conduct their test as part of the day's crash sequence. After all of the crash tests are conducted, team members will remove and store all instrumentation used and return to the conference hotel to begin the process of data analysis and presentation. A team conference room and computers loaded with all software will be provided. <br> <br>
          On the second day of the conference, teams will convene in the CTA conference room and continue to analyze all of the data collected with the goal of presenting the data and providing the data to MATAI conference attendee on the morning of the final conference day. <br><br>
          By the time the team members present their data, CTA attendees will experience the factors that go into putting on crash tests at a conference, gain perspective as to why there is a delay between testing, understand the complexity and pitfalls of conducting live, meaningful crash tests.

              <br>
              <div class="text-body1">Michael Rosenfield is an engineer with a BS in Biomedical Engineering from Case Western Reserve University. He consults as a traffic accident reconstructionist, biomechanic, and as an automotive test engineer. He has been involved with numerous low-speed crash tests, with instrumented volunteers. The results of some of these tests have been published with the Society of Automotive Engineers, and Collision, The International Compendium for Crash Research. He initially worked in a clinical medical setting, and then switched to engineering. In addition to accident reconstruction and biomechanics, he has spent the last 20 years running automotive handling tests, component testing, component failure analysis, setting up test instrumentation, and performing automotive crash testing. This involves inspection, repair and troubleshooting of various automotive systems and components. It also involves making sure that the test vehicles are functioning correctly and according to manufacturer’s specifications.
              <br><br>
              Mr. Rosenfield has co-authored numerous publications relating to this testing.
              <br><br>
              Mr Rosenfield has served on the crash committee and performed numerous crashes for Southwestern Association of Technical Accident Investigators (SATAI), Midwest Association of Technical Accident Investigators (MATAI), the ARC-CSI crash conference, the Illinois Association of Technical Accident Investigators (IATAI), Longmont, CO police department, and the Texas State Highway Patrol. The planning of these crash demonstrations involves the same principals and calculations used for accident reconstruction and biomechanics and involves placing bounds on the collision types and severities to ensure the safety and well-being of any participating human volunteers.
              <br><br>
              In order to enhance the area of crash testing, he designed and built the Phantom Driver Radio Control Remote driving system, a self-contained remote driving system for conducting collision testing and rollovers that can be installed in any vehicle in about an hour. It was first used at the 10th Annual ARC-CSI Crash conference in Las Vegas May, 2011, and has now been used for over 66 crashes, including 11 rollovers, and 2 intersection crashes.
              <br><br>
              Most recently, it has been used for police training - performing PIT maneuvers on high center-of-gravity vehicles.
              <br><br>
              He also designed and built the Phantom Rider, a self-contained remote driving system for motorcycles; first used at the 14th Annual ARC-CSI Crash conference in Las Vegas, June 2015.
