      <h5 class="text-center">The first part of this flashback will look at the first 20 years of MATAI <br>1986 - 2006</h5>
      <hr>
      <p>From humble beginnings in middle America, the Midwest Association of Technical Accident Investigators was organized in 1986 by Mike Adams, Ray Knight and Jon Wilson of Iowa.</p>
      <p>They started the idea of the organization and worked to develop the first group of individuals that would become the Founding Board of Directors</p>

      <p>In the first newsletter of 1987 there was discussions of the 1st Annual Meeting to be planned and a proposal for motorcycle sliding tests to be performed. As a part of this newsletter there were Acceleration Study data included for analysis purposes. </p>
      <p>In the 2nd newsletter of 1987 a brief history was narrated by authors Adams and Knight:</p>
      <img src="../../src/assets/history/mataiHistory.png" alt="history snippet" class="img-border shadow-3 q-mb-xl">
      <p>A continuing tradition of MATAI was first discussed in this newsletter as well -- how the organization depends on the active roll of its members:</p>
      <img src="../../src/assets/history/anyMember.png" alt="member involvement snippet" class="img-border shadow-3 q-mb-xl">
    </div>
    <div class="col-12 ">
      <p>The organization's first annual training session was held May 20-21, 1987 in Camp Dodge near Johnston, IA.</p>
      <img src="../../src/assets/history/firstTraining.png" alt="history snippet" class="img-border shadow-3 q-mb-xl">
      <p>The first <strong>Annual Meeting and Training Seminar</strong> (AMTS #1) was announced to be on May 17, 1988 at Ankeny, IA.</p>
      <img src="../../src/assets/history/trainingList88.png" alt="member involvement snippet" class="img-border shadow-3 q-mb-xl">
      <p>It is interesting to see the topics of the day and that many of those topics are still relevant today -- other than the 'video taped animations' of course.</p>
      <p>There is also mention of <a href="https://www.napars.org/">NAPARS</a>, the National Association of Professional Accident Reconstruction Specialists, Inc. -- which, first and foremost, is an even longer name than MATAI, at 77 characters if you include spaces! They are mentioned because they had proposed a potential partnership for a national bi-monthly newsletter since the printing and mailing of newsletters for these organizations was a significant undertaking and cost.</p>
      <p>In December 1988 NAPARS introduces the Accident Reconstruction Journal, which is still edited and published by Victor Craig to this day. Becoming a member of MATAI provides you with copies of this Journal back to 2013.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-12">
      <p>The third annual meeting - AMTS III - was held in Cedar Rapids, IA in May, 1990 and the newsletter reported over 100 members representing six states.</p>
      <p>The February 1991 newsletter informs the membership of training to be held in Council Bluffs (AMTS IV). The letter includes words from  <strong>Richard Yoder</strong> as President who is currently still actively engaged on the board in 2022!</p>
      <p>Interestingly there is also mention of a 'national certification' process moving forward and MATAI being a part of that effort. Think <a href="https://actar.org">ACTAR</a>!</p>
      <p>Continued conferences took place and in 1993 the newsletter took on a new look and feel as better technology took over things like word processing. </p>
      <img src="../../src/assets/history/1993NL.png" alt="member involvement snippet" class="img-border shadow-3 q-mb-xl">
      <p>In the Summer of 1993 it moved further into a newspaper style format and we notice the subtle removal of the Wyoming/Colorado shape from the logo.</p>
      <img src="../../src/assets/history/Summer93NL.png" alt="member involvement snippet" class="img-border shadow-3 q-mb-xl">
      <p>The Summer of '94 conference topic was School Bus crashes which was repeated again in 2019 with remote-controlled buses!</p>

    <div class="col-12 row">
      <p>In 1995 the conference was hosted for the first time outside of Iowa. Greg Vandenberg (NSP retired) hosted the conference on pedestrian crashes in Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>
      <p>There was also an extensive update to the ACTAR organization written by its then Vice Chair, Rusty Haight.</p>
      <p>The 1998 conference was held in Kansas City, MO and featured copious amounts of content on crush profiling, stiffness coefficients, Delta V from crush, etc.</p>
      <p>During the fall of 1998 the newly appointed Secretary/Treasurer (Greg Vandenberg) was announced by then President Al Mebus. A new logo emerged and there was a mention of MATAI being added to 'the Web'!  Later that fall the domain name <strong>www.matai.org</strong> was first 'owned' by MATAI.</p>

        <p>The Y2K brought the conference to Wisconsin for the first time and included great content and wonderful reviews from the attendees.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The Summer 2000 newsletter brings the first mention of 'The Automotive Blackbox' in an article authored by Greg Vandenberg. It provides a great insight into the beginnings of airbag data use in the field of crash reconstruction. Terms like SDM (Sensing and Diagnostic Module), CDR (Crash Data Retrieval) and Delta V (in the context of recorded data) are introduced. The Vertronix company is mentioned as the sole provider for the hardware and software needed to image the data on these GM SDMs.</p>
      <p>MATAI reaches 15 years old and is celebrated through a great article by Greg Vandenberg in the Spring 2001 newsletter. This article mimics the purpose of this webpage for current and future MATAI members. It reflects back to the beginnings of MATAI at a Baker's Restaurant in Des Moines, Iowa and forward to the future of the organization to come.</p>
      <p>The summer of 2001 brought the Conference to Colorado for the first time. The topic of motorcycles in crash investigation was hosted by Officers Jeff Groves and Guy Carroll of Ft. Collins and Loveland PDs respectively.</p>
      <p>2002 finds the conference hosted in Minnesota for the first time and was on multiple recon topics. In 2003 it moved back to Iowa and was hosted in Ames by Steve Hasstedt (ISU PD) for 'Back to Basics' presentations.</p>
      <p>2003 also ushered in a new look for the MATAI newsletter as well as news on the upcoming 2004 Conference to be held in Rock Island, Illinois and hosted by then board member John Clark.</p>
      <img src="../../src/assets/history/letterhead2003.png" alt="member involvement snippet" class="img-border shadow-3 q-mb-xl">

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 q-pa-sm">
        <p>The 2004 newsletter also introduces the now familiar circular MATAI logo in the flyer for the 2004 Conference in Rock Island.</p>
        <p>The 2005 Conference is set in the first time host state of South Dakota. It was hosted in Rapid City by Brad Booth and Mike Selves and included presentations on numerous topics by highly regarded instructors.</p>
        <p>Discussions begin amongst the board members in planning the 20th Anniversary of MATAI in 2006 as well as the Conference for that year that was set for another first time host state of Missouri (Kansas City).</p>
