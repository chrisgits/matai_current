          <div class="col-12 text-h5 q-mt-sm q-mb-xs">As crash investigators we are often presented with statements from drivers that “something broke” or malfunctioned in their vehicle which caused them to lose control and crash. On some occasions, we are presented with a crash in which there are no survivors. As those crashes are evaluated based solely on the available roadway and vehicle evidence, sometimes that roadway or vehicle evidence can indicate a possible mechanical failure with the vehicle prior to the crash. In this course, taught be David Hallman and Kent Boots, we will spend half of the time in the classroom and the other half in the shop inspecting multiple vehicles of various types and ages. Students will inspect, disassemble, and evaluate vehicle condition and vehicle component failures to determine if those failures could be a potential cause for the loss of control and / or a crash. This course will cover examples of roadway evidence as well as the pre-crash mechanical failures which produced it. This class will also focus on giving you the general skills to assess the post-crash mechanical condition of passenger vehicles and light trucks. Most importantly, this class will help you evaluate your own skills and determine when you may need to seek a specialist to assist you in evaluating possible contributing mechanical issues with a crash-involved vehicle.</div>
          <div class="col-12 text-h5 q-mt-sm q-mb-xs">This course will be a HANDS-ON course presented by David Hallman and Kent Boots, both respected experts in the national crash reconstruction community.</div>
          <div class="col-12 text-h5 q-mt-sm q-mb-xs">There will be <span class="text-bold">limited seating of 21 students</span> for this course. 7 teams of 3 with 7 vehicles for hands-on mechanical inspections with a high instructor to student ratio! Held in a temperature-controlled indoor space for the comfort of the attendees in Iowa in February!</div>
          <div class="col-12 text-h5 q-mt-sm q-mb-xs">We will be lodged at the nearby <span class="text-bold">Comfort Inn and Suites</span>. A Group rate for the hotel has been set at <span class="text-bold">$80/night</span>. When you make reservations simply advise the front desk you are with the MATAI group for these dates.</div>

          The forensic science of collision reconstruction goes far beyond that which is learned in traditional training. Understanding physics and mathematics, and developing proficiency in those disciplines is only the foundation. The factors which contribute to the cause of collisions are often far more complex than simply determining speed or understanding the basics of time and distance.
          <br>
          Nighttime collisions pose a special set of problems which a Collision Reconstructionist needs to approach with both an appreciation for that which may seem obvious but is not, and a plan as to
          how best to analyze the often complex variables they are presented with.
        </div>
        <div class="text-black text-body1 q-mt-sm">
          Understanding visibility and how to document this evidence is key to forming a solid opinion as to causal factors in nighttime vehicle collisions.
