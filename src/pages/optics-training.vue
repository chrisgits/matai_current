                  Mr. Sobek is a physicist and forensic engineer at Wolf Technical Services, Inc. in Indianapolis, Indiana. He holds a degree in Physics from Thiel College in Green-ville, PA and has additional training at UCLA and Purdue University. He is a member of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America and is licensed as a Professional Engi-neer in Indiana. Since April 1988, he has partic-ipated in several thousand accident analyses involving lighting and visibility issues and has testified in several hundred cases in United States and Canadian courts.

                  Prior to joining Wolf, Mr. Sobek worked for 20 years as a Research Physicist and Electrical En-gineer at the Naval Avionics Center, Indianapo-lis, developing missile guidance systems. He is a co-patent holder on DSMAC, the precision electro-optical guidance system currently used on the Navy’s Tomahawk cruise missile.

                  In 2007, after being asked several times by Law Enforcement officers whether he could teach a course in lighting and photography, Mr. Sobek decided that there was an unfulfilled need and a potential market. In August 2007, he started Clearly Visible Presentations with a mission to teach the science and technology of optics, lighting, visibility and digital photography to the forensic investigation community.
