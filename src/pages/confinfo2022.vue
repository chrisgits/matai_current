          The MATAI annual conference continues to grow each year. We have advanced our crash test research in recent years to include highly sophisticated crash test instrumentation and robotic steering devices to steer the vehicles into various crash scenarios.  For the first time this fall, MATAI will offer attendees the option to participate in the “Crash Test Academy” (CTA), which will provide hands-on experience with all aspects of planning, execution and presentation of full scale automobile crash tests. For more information on CTA content, cost and instructors please visit the <a href="/cta">CTA</a> page.

                  William Messerschmidt is a former police officer and traffic homicide investigator. After serving the City of Auburn with distinction for 8 years, Mr. Messerschmidt left government service to work with the late Dr. Edward L. Robinson where his work was focused on the investigation and analysis of commercial and heavy vehicle crashes. While working alongside the physicists and engineers at Robinson & Associates, Bill was introduced to Dr. Jeffery Muttart and almost immediately went back to school for the study of Human Factors Psychology and Engineering.

                  Since that time, Bill has studied Human Factors, focusing on transportation and industrial safety, at the University of Idaho, Emory-Riddell Aeronautical University, and The University of Aberdeen. Today, Bill’s Accident Reconstruction work is primarily focused on applying Human Factors science to the analysis of traffic crashes and industrial accidents.
